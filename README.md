# Unexpected Behavior with Implicit Conversion Operators in C#

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with implicit conversion operators in C#. Implicit conversions can be convenient, but they can also lead to unexpected behavior if not designed and used carefully, particularly when combined with operator overloading. The example shows how implicit conversions combined with arithmetic operators may not always behave as intuitively expected.

## Bug Description
The `MyClass` uses implicit conversion operators to convert between `MyClass` objects and integers.  While seemingly straightforward, combining these operators with arithmetic operations (such as addition) introduces unexpected complexity and potential for errors. The behavior of the addition operation involving the implicit conversion may not always meet expectations leading to bugs hard to find.

## How to Reproduce
1. Compile and run the provided C# code (`bug.cs`).
2. Observe the output.  While the initial conversions work as expected, the results of adding an integer to a `MyClass` object might behave differently than anticipated, especially if not carefully tested.

## Solution
The solution (`bugSolution.cs`) addresses the issue by providing an explicit method for addition instead of relying solely on implicit conversions and operator overloading to handle addition. This approach enhances code clarity, maintainability, and reduces the chance of encountering such unexpected behavior.
